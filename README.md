# FilmQueryProject

# Description
<p> The purpose of this project is to allow a user to look up films by film id, or by a keyword search that checks for that keyword against the title and the description.

# Lessons Learned
<p>This project taught me a lot about accessing information from a database. This program challenged me and the knowledge I've gained through this course thus far. I learned how to get the information I need from the database and properly display the information to the user. </p>
